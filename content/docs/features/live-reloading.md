Static uses the [live-reload npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/livereload-js) to detect changes to the code and files in your website and live reload the page. This creates an excellent developer experience and allows you to build your site much faster.

## Setup

Live reload is automatically injected into the page when your run `static dev`, you'll see a script at the bottom of the page called livereload.js and this is the script that's responsible for reloading the page. Your site will live-reload when any file is updated on your site.

## Configuration

Right now there are no configuration options with live-reload, it just works out of the box. But, if necessary we may add some additional configs in the future. Right now it works with all the files in your site; however, there may be some edge-cases where you want to create custom rules. Be sure to check back for updated options or if you would like to contribute code, make sure to open a PR in the <a href="https://github.com/thedevdojo/static" target="_blank" class="text-yellow-300 underline">Github Repo</a>.

Save time and see changes instantly with Live-reload! ðŸ’ª
