If you do not want to host your website on Github pages, you can host with a handful of other alternatives.

## Website Build

When you run the `static build` command your website will be built into a new folder named `_site`. This folder will contain all the contents for your website. You can simply move the contents to any server and your site will be served up accordingly.

Remember that if you are hosting your website inside of a subfolder, you will need to pass the full URL to the build command in order for all the assets and images to link up correctly. Here's an example:

```
static build https://my-website/subfolder/
```
