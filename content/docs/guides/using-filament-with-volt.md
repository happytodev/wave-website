# Using Filament with Volt

Using Filament with Wave and Volt can make your life a lot easier. In this guide we will use the example from the <a href="{ url('/docs/your-functionality' )}">Your Functionality</a> section and show you how to implement the same functionality using the <a href="https://filamentphp.com/docs/tables/installation" target="_blank">Table Builder</a> and the <a href="https://filamentphp.com/docs/forms/installation" target="_blank">Form Builder</a>.

  - [Using the Table Builder](#using-the-table-builder)
  - [Using the Form Builder](#using-the-form-builder)


We will assume that you've already added the **database migration** and the **model** for the `projects` table in <a href="{ url('/docs/your-functionality' )}">this section</a>. Be sure to finish that section before continuing with this guide.

## Using the Table Builder

Looking at the **volt project page** that we created inside the theme page directory at `pages/projects/index.blade.php` we can utilize the Table builder to easily display our projects in a nice table view:

```php
<?php

>
```
