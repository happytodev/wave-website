## Getting Started

**Wave** is built on top of the popular <a href="https://laravel.com" target="_blank">Laravel Framework</a>. It's not necessary that you know Laravel; however, a basic understanding of the framework will definitely help.

Building apps with Wave should be fun and exciting! It has a ton of features to save you hundreds of hours. Let's breifly cover some of the key features.

## About Wave

<a name="key-features"></a>
### Key Features

Here's an overview of Wave's key features, which we'll explore in more detail later.

**Authentication** - Wave ships with authentication allowing users to Login, Register, Verify Email, Password Reset/Confirmation, and enable Two-Factor authentication.

**User Management** - Users can have roles and permissions to access certain parts of your app. Wave also includes features for impersonation, user management, and user profiles.

**Billing**

You can easily integrate Stripe or Paddle into your application. Create subscription plans and associate them with user roles to control access to specific features.

**Changelog** - Creating a changelog is a great way to notify users about new features and fixes while keeping yourself accountable. Document your progress in the changelog.

**Blog** - Write blog posts and attract free traffic from search engines. Share your knowledge about technology and tools as you build your SaaS.

**API** - API tokens can be created for API access. These tokens are used to generate Bearer tokens for authenticating future API requests.

**Admin** - Wave leverages FilamentPHP for admin CRUD functionality. You may also use the Table Builder, Form Builder, Notifications, and more within theme files.

**Themes** - Customize your app's look and feel with Wave's theming system. Each theme in `resources/views/theme` includes its own assets and views.
